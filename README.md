# SMART CROWD ANALYZER


Smart Crowd Analyzer is a product which can enhance your Managing experience. Field of area we implied our product is Shopping Mall. Our Product can: 

  - Count the people Entering and leaving a place. (People Counting)
  - Detect Age , Gender , Emotion and Group of peoples. (Stock Management)
  - Heatmap of platform (Occupancy Management)
  - Statistical Report (Daily/Monthly/Yearly Report)
  
Brochure is Uploaded in files 

## Age and Gender detection:
Datasets were taken from:

Age and Gender Detection Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/jangedoo/utkface-new?

Data was Uploaded , Trained , preprocesed and then Evaluated. The accuracy we got was 60-70% for Age Detection . and 80% for Gender detection by this Model.

The Code is under: Age_and_Gender_Prediction.ipynb

## Emotion detection:
Dataset was taken from:

Emotion Detection Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/shawon10/ckplus

Data was Uploaded , Trained , preprocesed and then Evaluated. The accuracy we got was 100% training accuracy and 100% validation accuracy.
>Note: Whenever a model gives a 100% accuracy on test data, we need to check the training accuracy, if that is also 100%. It means the model is actually overfitting and the test set is having a very close distribution to the train set. So, it is showing great results. I think in these circumstances, itâ€™s better to use cross-validation to get the correct intuition of how the model actually works

The Code is under: Emotion_Detection.ipynb

##Age , Gender and Emotion detection by Deepface

To improve it accuracy wise , what we adopted is DEEPFACE METHOD.
## For Deep Face:
### Dependencies 
For Colab : Deepface.ipynb is uploaded.

If you're working on a Local Machine, install the dependencies from your terminal with -

pip install -r requirements.txt
    - Run
    -Download the Repository.
    -Install the Dependencies in your system through your terminal/cmd using -
    -pip install -r requirements.
    -Open DeepFace.ipynb using any ipynb based console. (Eg- Colab, Jupyter Lab etc)
### For Live Facial Recognition and Verification,
   
 run the following command in your Terminal/cmd - python deep_face.py
